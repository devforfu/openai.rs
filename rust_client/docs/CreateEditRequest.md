# CreateEditRequest

## Properties

Name | Type | Description | Notes
------------ | ------------- | ------------- | -------------
**model** | **String** | ID of the model to use. You can use the `text-davinci-edit-001` or `code-davinci-edit-001` model with this endpoint. | 
**input** | Option<**String**> | The input text to use as a starting point for the edit. | [optional][default to ]
**instruction** | **String** | The instruction that tells the model how to edit the prompt. | 
**n** | Option<**i32**> | How many edits to generate for the input and instruction. | [optional][default to 1]
**temperature** | Option<**f32**> | What sampling temperature to use, between 0 and 2. Higher values like 0.8 will make the output more random, while lower values like 0.2 will make it more focused and deterministic.  We generally recommend altering this or `top_p` but not both.  | [optional][default to 1]
**top_p** | Option<**f32**> | An alternative to sampling with temperature, called nucleus sampling, where the model considers the results of the tokens with top_p probability mass. So 0.1 means only the tokens comprising the top 10% probability mass are considered.  We generally recommend altering this or `temperature` but not both.  | [optional][default to 1]
